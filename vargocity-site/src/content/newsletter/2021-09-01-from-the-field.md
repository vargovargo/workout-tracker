It's September in California and the air is orange again.

I've spent the last year deep in data about wildfire smoke — who breathes it, where it lands, what it costs people in terms of health and days lost and hospital bills. The patterns are depressingly clear. Smoke doesn't fall equally. Communities that are already under stress — lower incomes, older housing, less access to air conditioning and filtration — bear more of it.

This is a story about compounding. Climate change makes smoke worse. Poverty makes smoke more dangerous. And policies that ignore these intersections will make both worse together.

There's a lot I can't say publicly about the work. But I can say this: we have the tools to measure equity. We have the data to see who's being left behind. The question is whether we use them.

More soon. Stay safe out there.
