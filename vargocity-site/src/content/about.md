I started as an engineer. Chemical engineering at Michigan, 2001 — a degree that taught me to measure things precisely, to think in systems, to ask: what's actually happening here, and why?

But somewhere in my twenties, the question that started to matter most wasn't *how* but *who*. Who bears the cost? Who gets left out when we build a city, plan a highway, design a neighborhood? Who benefits when we get it right?

The through-line I'd name now, looking back: learning at the cutting edge, doing hard and important things, building something you can point to. Every career move since Michigan has been a bet on that combination being available to me.

That question pulled me south to Atlanta, where I pioneered a dual degree between Georgia Tech's urban planning program and Emory's school of public health. The connection seemed obvious to me: urban planning and public health are both fundamentally about how environments shape human lives — and whose lives, specifically. I finished the PhD in 2012 with a dissertation on how cities plan (or don't) for extreme heat. The built environment gets hot. Not everyone has the same way to get cool.

From Atlanta I went to Madison, Wisconsin, as a postdoc at the Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies and the Global Health Institute. I was thinking about cities every day. And I kept noticing the gap between what researchers knew and what cities could use. In 2015, I founded the **UniverCity Alliance** to try to close that gap — a cross-campus initiative to connect UW-Madison's research capacity directly to the communities that needed it most. Its mission was explicit: equity, democracy, and sustainability. We built partnerships with twenty-nine Wisconsin communities. The work was about building trust as much as generating knowledge.

Then I went west. The California Department of Public Health hired me as lead scientist for its **Climate Change and Health Equity** program. I helped develop the state's COVID-19 Health Equity Metric — a tool designed to direct resources toward communities at greatest risk. I worked on understanding how wildfire smoke falls disproportionately on people who are already most vulnerable: communities with lower incomes, limited English proficiency, housing instability. The unequal nature of climate impacts isn't incidental — it's structural. And it demands attention to root causes, not just symptoms.

Now I'm at the **Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco**, where I research how climate risk intersects with economic opportunity in lower-income communities. The framing has shifted from health to economics, but the question is the same: *for whom?*

I coined the phrase "metro sapiens" to describe the species we're becoming. More than half of humanity now lives in cities. Within a generation it will be two-thirds. The city is our natural habitat — the environment we've built for ourselves. And like any environment, it can sustain us or harm us, depending on how it's designed and for whose benefit.

The goal, in my work and in my life, has been to make healthy choices easy choices. To build environments — whether urban or institutional — where the default option is the good one, and where that default applies to everyone equally.

Lately, the question has grown. The framework I've used for climate — measuring who bears the burden, identifying root causes, building tools that make the disparity legible to people who can act on it — applies directly to AI systems. I'm drawn to that intersection: powerful technology and who bears its costs. It's the same question in a new habitat.

Outside of work, I spend a lot of time in the Sierra Nevada — measuring altitude, because the window for hard climbing is finite and worth paying attention to. I build furniture from salvaged wood. I read widely and write when I can. I've been to a few dozen countries and am always planning the next trip.

This site is a log of the things worth protecting — and what I've done with the time.
