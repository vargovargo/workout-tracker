The question I've spent a career asking has found its most consequential application. For twenty-five years, the framework has been the same: measure who bears the burden, identify root causes, build tools that make the disparity legible to people who can act on it. I applied it to cities, to climate, to wildfire smoke, to COVID, to economic vulnerability. Now I'm turning it toward AI systems, because the distributional consequences of AGI may define the next generation of human wellbeing. It's the same question in a more urgent habitat.

It started with a chemical engineering degree at Michigan, in 2001 — a program that turned out to be less about thermodynamics than about learning how to learn. Measure things carefully before believing them. Think in systems. Ask: what's actually happening here, and why?

But somewhere in my twenties, the question that started to matter most wasn't *how* but *who*. Who bears the cost? Who gets left out when we build a city, plan a highway, design a neighborhood? Who benefits when we get it right?

That question pulled me south to Atlanta, where I pioneered a dual degree between Georgia Tech's urban planning program and Emory's school of public health. The connection seemed obvious to me: urban planning and public health are both fundamentally about how environments shape human lives — and whose lives, specifically. I finished the PhD in 2012 with a dissertation on how cities plan (or don't) for extreme heat. The built environment gets hot. Not everyone has the same way to get cool.

From Atlanta I went to Madison, Wisconsin, as a postdoc working with **Jonathan Patz** at the Global Health Institute and the Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies. Patz's IPCC research helped earn the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize; being in proximity to that kind of ambition clarified what research could be for. **Joel Rogers** — MacArthur Fellow, founder of the Center on Wisconsin Strategy, and the person behind the High Road framework — was across campus. His argument that a thriving economy and a just one aren't trade-offs has shaped how I think about every policy question since. In 2015, I founded the **UniverCity Alliance** to try to close the gap between what researchers knew and what cities could use — a cross-campus initiative connecting UW-Madison's research capacity directly to the communities that needed it most. We worked with twenty-nine Wisconsin communities. I believe we reach better decisions when we invite more diverse viewpoints into the room, and in practice that means showing up, listening, and making the research useful to the people closest to the problem.

Then I went west. The California Department of Public Health hired me as lead scientist for its **Climate Change and Health Equity** program. I worked on how wildfire smoke falls disproportionately on communities with lower incomes, limited housing options, and environmental exposures that compound over time. The unequal distribution of harm isn't incidental — it's structural. And it demands attention to root causes, not just symptoms.

In early 2020, I was pulled from that work to lead the state's COVID-19 modeling effort. We built a public forecasting dashboard that drew on data ensembles from hundreds of citizen scientists — one of the stranger and more generative collaborative experiences of my career. I developed the state's COVID-19 Health Equity Metric to direct resources toward the communities at greatest risk. Working through all of it with **DJ Patil** — the first U.S. Chief Data Scientist — pressed me to think rigorously about the ethics of every decision: who sees the data, who doesn't, what the model hides, and who gets hurt when it's wrong. I carry that framework into everything since.

Now I'm at the **Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco**, where I research how climate risk intersects with economic opportunity in lower-income communities. The framing has shifted from health to economics, but the question is the same: *for whom?*

I coined the phrase "metro sapiens" to describe the species we're becoming. More than half of humanity now lives in cities. Within a generation it will be two-thirds. The city is our natural habitat — the environment we've built for ourselves. And like any environment, it can sustain us or harm us, depending on how it's designed and for whose benefit.

The goal, in my work and in my life, has been to make healthy choices easy choices. To build environments — whether urban or institutional — where the default option is the good one, and where that default applies equally. I think we're stronger when we share the things we value and are honest with each other about what those things are.

Outside of work: as much time in the Sierra Nevada as possible. Furniture built from salvaged wood. Code written for tools that didn't exist. Food grown, friends fed, peaks logged. Physical activity is a miracle drug and I try not to forget it.

This site is a log of the time — at work, at leisure, and at the larger scale of a life in motion.
