More than half of humanity now lives in cities. Within a generation it will be two-thirds. If you want to understand human beings in the 21st century, you have to understand cities.

I've started using the term *metro sapiens* to describe the species we're becoming. It's not quite a scientific taxonomy — more of a provocation. We are city-dwellers now. The urban environment is our natural habitat, in the same sense that a savanna was the habitat of our ancestors: the place that shapes our behavior, our health, our social organization, our sense of what's normal.

The question isn't whether cities will dominate human life. They already do. The question is what kind of cities we build — and for whom.

Cities can sustain the planet's life support systems or degrade them. They can improve people's lives or concentrate poverty and pollution. The choices we make about density, transit, green space, housing, and public health infrastructure aren't neutral technical decisions. They are moral decisions about who thrives and who doesn't.

That's what urban planning is for. That's why it matters.
