This book does something unusual: it takes seriously the question of *how* climate change gets addressed at the institutional level. Not the science, not the catastrophe, but the grinding, procedural, political work of building new systems.

Robinson is optimistic in the way that only someone who has read a lot of history can be — it's not naive optimism, it's the kind that holds both the horror and the possibility in the same frame.

The chapter on carbon currency has stayed with me. The idea that you need to make the right action the economically rational action — not just the morally correct one — maps onto a lot of the work I do around built environments and health. You can't just educate people into better choices. You have to redesign the system so the default is healthier.

Recommended for anyone who works in policy and needs a long view.
