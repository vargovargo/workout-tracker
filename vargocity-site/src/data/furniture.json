    "year": 2014,
    "materials": ["cedar"],
    "notes": "Made for my sister's wedding. The design comes from Aldo Leopold himself — he built the original from Wisconsin River materials. The trick is you sit backward, facing away, so you can use binoculars or a camera without leaning forward. It's a bench designed for watching.",

    "year": 2016,
    "materials": ["reclaimed ash", "salvaged hairpin legs"],
    "notes": "The wood came from trees that fell in storms and was given away as slabs at the 2014 Atwood Festival in Madison. I dried it in my garage for two years before building. The hairpin legs came off a tiled table I found on the street. It ended up taller than I intended — works well as a TV stand.",
